                <p class="Ans">
                    Ans: <br> Global scope: <br>
                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                    program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.<br>
                    block scope: <br>
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly brackets {}.

                <p class="Ans"> Ans: <br>
                    The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that
                    generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler
                    ("dispatches the event").
